        ðŸ”¹ How to Avoid Hasty Abstraction? âœ… Follow the "Rule of Three" â€“ Only
        abstract when you see at least three concrete use cases. âœ… Start Simple
        â€“ Write direct, clear code first, then refactor if necessary. âœ… Focus
        on Real Needs â€“ Don't anticipate future problems that may never come. âœ…
        Use YAGNI ("You Ain't Gonna Need It") â€“ Avoid adding features before
        they're needed. âœ… Refactor When Ready â€“ Instead of guessing the best
        abstraction, wait until patterns naturally emerge.
